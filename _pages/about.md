I'm a senior researcher at [SAFARI research group](https://safari.ethz.ch) at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/een.html), lead by [Prof. Onur Mutlu](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu). My current research interests include  memory systems, hardware security, machine learning, microarchitecture, storage systems, processing in memory, and [more](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MzblxxcAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1).

I earned my PhD from [University of Santiago de Compostela (USC)](https://www.usc.es) under the supervision of [Elisardo Antelo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elisardo_Antelo) and [Javier Bruguera](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Javier_Bruguera). During my PhD, I visited [I-ACOMA research group](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/) at [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://uiuc.edu), lead by [Prof. Josep Torrellas](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html). I also adquired industry experience in [IBM R&D Labs](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/haifa/) at Haifa (with [Olga Golovanevsky's](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Olga-Golovanevsky-2028453878), [Marina Biberstein](https://dblp.org/pid/44/5270.html), and [Bilha Mendelson](https://dblp.org/pid/71/2760.html)), and [Recore Systems](https://www.design-reuse.com/news/35332/recore-systems-ip-european-multi-core-space-processor.html) at Enschede. After my PhD, I continued my research on computer architecture with several groups in Industry and Academia, including [Universidade Nova de Lisboa](https://www.unl.pt) with [Prof. Joao Lourenco](https://docentes.fct.unl.pt/joao-lourenco), [LSC](https://lsc.ic.unicamp.br/) group at [Unicamp](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/), with [Prof. Rodolfo Azevedo](https://ic.unicamp.br/en/~rodolfo/), and [Xilinx Research Labs](https://www.xilinx.com/about/research-labs.html) at Dublin, with [Michaela Blott](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michaela_Blott) and [Yaman Umuroglu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yaman_Umuroglu).
